  I believe knowledge should be shared selflessly. I also believe knowledge
  should be shared selfishly. We can only improve ourselves once we understand
  how to teach others what we know.

  This is the reason I started this blog. This is the reason I write open-source
  software. I'm just selfishly improving myself while selflessly helping others.
